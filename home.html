        <p class = "screen-only">My name is Anushka (pictured below while holding swanky peach colored Vans in Madewell). I am a rising sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania (<i>hurrah hurrah</i>). I am currently taking CS50 to learn some funky things about web design and to fill my quarantined days.</p>

        <p class = "screen-only">Our first homework is to put together a website. I will admit... I am getting major 2011 flashbacks from my blog about Avatar the Last Airbender, my recess whereabouts, and a time in my life that I would prefer not to look back on. In other words, the bar for my websites is very <i> low</i>. (Before you ask (<i>or probably don't</i>), I sadly do not have access to my old goldmine site). </p>
        <p class = "screen-only"><i>Anyways,</i> this website is a fun conglomeration of my personality and project requirements. The entire site exudes chaotic energy... and I love it. Hope you will too! :) </p>

# Project 0

Hello! Welcome to my first assignment and website for this class. 

The features of my website are as follows:
hello.html (Homepage):
    1. All of the styling for this website is contained in the style.scss/style.css file. This file contains two variables, the nesting %style, and inheritance between p and p::selection. 
    2. You can highlight/select the paragraph for some different coloring text/background.
    3. The three images of myself are all aligned and will resize to the screen to maintain the trio. 
    4. If you try to print the screen, the majority of the text will vanish (@media). 
    5. At the end, there is an ordered list of links to all the other html pages of the website. 

pome.html (Curiosity):
    1. Each question is represented as a container from Bootstrap and resizes as needed.
    2. Each question has a different way to answer. One datalist, one fill-in, and one radio button.
    3. To go back to the homepage, there is a Bootstrap button.

lactose.html (Intolerance):
    1. If you hover over the image, it changes.
    2. To go back to the homepage, there is a Bootstrap button.

pun.html (Puns):
    1. There is a guide with shortcut links to each of the categories.
    2. There is an ordered list of unordered lists of puns.
    3. To go back to the homepage, there is a Bootstrap button.

music.html (Music):
    1. The title will change depending on the size of the screen (@media 1000px).
    2. There is a table of all the songs and their attributes.
    3. All the "Listen"s are links to online versions of the song. 
    4. To go back to the homepage, there is a Bootstrap button.
